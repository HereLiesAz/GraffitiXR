The radius of the splat dots isn't exactly the problem. There are enough of them that they block the view anyway. So let's do this: instead of having dots appear, let's have dots disappear. AR mode will start off with a dark transparent layer over the entire world. The spat dots should mask that layer, thus removing the dots, rather than adding them.
