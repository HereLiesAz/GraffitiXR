Get this app production-ready by: 1. Go through each todo item and determine whether it is correctly and fully implemented. 2. Write tests to make sure they stay that way. 3. Run the test suite. 4. If any tests fail, analyze the errors and debug the code. 5. Refactor for clarity and efficiency. 6. Repeat until all tests are green.
