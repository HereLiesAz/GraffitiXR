When I press the isolate or outline buttons, for some reason the app is suddenly not retaining those changes. The background disappears for a moment, then returns. The image is turned into lines, and then reverts. Fix this. They must persist across modes, and make sure these edits are also saved in the project file. Also, upon either loading or creating a project when the app first opens, the user should be taken directly to Trace mode so they can work on their edits without the computational load of the camera view.
