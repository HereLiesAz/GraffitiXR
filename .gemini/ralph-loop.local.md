In AR mode, the splats are being shown by enormous circles that block the user's view through the camera. If we were getting a real-time 3D model of the world then blocking the view would be fine, because it'd look exactly the same as the camera view. But that's currently not what we have. So you need to sort this out, find a different way to indicate that an area has been splatted that doesn't involve obstructing the user's ability to see the thing they're painting on.
