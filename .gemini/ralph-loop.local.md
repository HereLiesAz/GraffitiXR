Analyze the app--Read all its documentation and all of its source code. Understand the purpose and goals of the project. Give me your analysis of the repository. Detail errors, problems, incompletely developed functions, and inconsistencies. There are a few issues that I need your help with. 1) the app needs to be further modularised, dividing ui elements into modules, functionality into modules, screens into modules, with everything so separated that it becomes impossible to duplicate code, or to mistake the functionality of one thing for another. 2) With that refactoring accomplished, reworking the documentation--everything from the kdocs to the markdown files in the root, to the documentation in the docs folder--to reflect the modular refactoring, and lay out a step by step process for accomplishing the final, robust, productionready state that we must FINALLY achieve. 3) The testing suite must be expanded to enforce the modular structure.
