## **Three Ways to Plan Your Attack**

This ain't a one-trick pony. GraffitiXR gives you three modes to work with, so you can plan your piece no matter where you are.

### **1. AR Mode: See it on the Spot**

> The real deal. Use your phone's camera to project your art directly onto any wall, train car, or whatever spot you've got your eye on.
>
> 1.  **Scope it out:** Point your camera at the surface.
> 2.  **Mark your territory:** Tap "Add Marker" to drop four points, defining the corners of your piece.
> 3.  **Throw it up:** Watch your art snap into place, perfectly warped to the wall's perspective.

### **2. Mock-up Mode: The Digital Blackbook**

> Got a photo of a dope spot? Use Mock-up Mode to sketch out your ideas on a static image.
>
> 1.  **Pick your canvas:** Select a background image from your gallery.
> 2.  **Choose your piece:** Select the art you want to overlay.
> 3.  **Warp and Weave:** Drag the four corners of your image to match the perspective of the wall in the photo. Use two-finger gestures to scale and rotate your art until it's just right.

### **3. On-the-Go Mode: Quick and Dirty**

> No AR? No problem. This mode overlays your art directly onto your camera feed. It's a quick and easy way to get a feel for how your piece will look in a space, without the need for surface detection.
