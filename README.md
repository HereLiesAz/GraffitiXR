# GraffitiXR

GraffitiXR is an advanced augmented reality application for Android, designed to assist artists in visualizing and planning large-scale artworks such as murals. The app provides a suite of tools to project a digital image onto a real-world surface, offering a seamless workflow from concept to creation.

## Features

-   **Persistent AR Mockup Mode:** Leveraging ARCore and OpenCV, this mode allows artists to anchor a digital image to a physical location with high precision. The application's key feature is its ability to save the location "fingerprint," allowing the artist to return to the site at a later time and have the image overlay automatically reappear in the correct position, size, and orientation.
-   **Image Trace Mode:** A non-AR mode that overlays a semi-transparent image on the camera feed, useful for direct tracing when the device is held in a fixed position (e.g., on a tripod).
-   **Static Mockup Mode:** Allows artists to create a quick visualization by taking a photo of a surface and using perspective warp tools to fit their artwork onto it.
-   **Project Library:** Save and load multiple projects, preserving image selections, adjustments, and AR fingerprints.
-   **Advanced Image Adjustments:** Fine-tune the overlay with opacity, contrast, saturation, and curves adjustments. Includes background removal and blending modes.
-   **Intuitive UI:** A streamlined interface with a navigation rail, gesture controls, and a dedicated adjustments panel.
-   **Settings & Updates:** Built-in update checker for experimental releases.
