# GraffitiXR

GraffitiXR is an android app for street artists. There are plenty of apps that overlay an image on your camera view so you can trace it, but when I'm painting a mural based on a sketch I have saved on my phone, using a tripod can really ebb my flow. I'm all over the damn place. Me, I put my phone in my pocket. Even the apps that use AR to keep the image steady and in one place can't deal with abysmal darkness of my pocket.

So I'm making something better by repurposing the grid method. I was always thinking, "Why can't these specific doodles be saved, like a persistent anchor, so the overlay is always just plain in the right spot?" So, now, that's what those doodles do. 
Progress tracking replaces those marks with the piece itself as you go, like an ever-evolving fingerprinted target.
GraffitiXR is an advanced augmented reality application for Android, designed to assist artists in visualizing and planning large-scale artworks such as murals. The app provides a suite of tools to project a digital image onto a real-world surface, offering a seamless workflow from concept to creation.

Just for shits and giggles, I included the non-AR version for image tracing just like you get with those other apps, too. Just in case you cray like that.      
Or if you cray-cray, there's Mockup mode. Nab a picture of the wall, cuz I got some quick tools for a quick mockup.
And if you've got nothing to prove, you just want something copied onto paper perfectly, Trace mode allows you to use your phone as a lightbox, keeping your screen on with the brightness turned up, locking your image into place and blocking all touches until you're finished. 


## Features

-   **AR Grid Mode:** Leveraging ARCore and OpenCV, this mode allows artists to anchor a digital image to a physical location with high precision. The application's key feature is its ability to save the location "fingerprint," allowing the artist to return to the site at a later time and have the image overlay automatically reappear in the correct position, size, and orientation.
-   **Rectify Image Target:** Create planar AR targets from angled photos by manually selecting corners, allowing for robust tracking even on skewed surfaces.
-   **Non-AR Overlay Mode:** A non-AR mode that overlays a semi-transparent image on the camera feed, useful for direct tracing when the device is held in a fixed position (e.g., on a tripod).
-   **Mockup Mode:** Allows artists to create a quick visualization by taking a photo of a surface and using perspective warp tools to fit their artwork onto it.
-   **Tracing Mode:** Turn your phone into a lightbox for tracing an image onto paper.

-   **Project Library:** Save and load multiple projects, preserving image selections, adjustments, and AR fingerprints.
-   **Advanced Image Adjustments:** Fine-tune the overlay with opacity, contrast, saturation, and curves adjustments. Includes background removal and blending modes.
-   **Intuitive UI:** A streamlined interface with a navigation rail, gesture controls, and a dedicated adjustments panel.
-   **Settings & Updates:** Built-in update checker for experimental releases.
