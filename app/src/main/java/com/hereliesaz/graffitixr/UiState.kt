/**
 * Represents the complete and immutable state of the user interface at any given time.
 *
 * This data class acts as the single source of truth for the UI. It is observed by the
 * composables, and any change to an instance of this class will trigger a recomposition
 * to reflect the new state. All properties have default values to ensure a consistent
 * initial state.
 *
 * This class is [Parcelable] to allow it to be saved and restored from a [SavedStateHandle],
 * ensuring the UI state survives process death.
 *
 * @property editorMode The currently active editor mode, which determines the main screen content. See [EditorMode].
 * @property backgroundImageUri The [Uri] of the image selected by the user to serve as the background. This is only used in [EditorMode.STATIC].
 * @property overlayImageUri The [Uri] of the mural or artwork image selected by the user to be overlaid on the background or camera feed.
 * @property opacity The transparency of the overlay image, ranging from 0.0f (fully transparent) to 1.0f (fully opaque).
 * @property contrast The contrast of the overlay image. A value of 1.0f is normal contrast.
 * @property saturation The color saturation of the overlay image. A value of 0.0f is grayscale, and 1.0f is normal saturation.
 * @property scale The uniform scale factor applied to the overlay image in non-AR mode.
 * @property offset The offset of the overlay image in non-AR mode.
 * @property points A list of four [Offset] points representing the corners of the overlay image for perspective warping in static mode.
 * @property arImagePose The pose of the AR image in the real world.
 * @property arFeaturePattern The feature pattern detected in the AR scene.
 * @property isArLocked A flag indicating whether the AR image is locked in place.
 * @property completedOnboardingModes A set containing the [EditorMode]s for which the user has already seen and dismissed the onboarding dialog. This is used to prevent showing the dialog repeatedly.
