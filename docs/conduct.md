# Code of Conduct

## For Contributors
1.  **Respect the Architecture:** Do not introduce heavy frameworks (Retrofit, Hilt) unless absolutely necessary. Keep it lean.
2.  **Respect the User:** Do not add tracking, analytics, or telemetry without explicit, opt-in consent.
3.  **Respect the Device:** This app runs hot. Optimize your loops. Don't drain the user's battery for no reason.

## For Users (The "Street" Rule)
* **Legal:** We do not condone vandalism. Ensure you have permission to paint the walls you are scanning.
* **Safety:** Do not use the AR mode while walking near traffic. The "Confidence Engine" is mesmerizing, but a bus is real.
