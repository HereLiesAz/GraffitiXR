# Code of Conduct & Ethics

This document outlines the ethical guidelines and conduct expectations for developers and AI agents contributing to GraffitiXR.

## **1. Respect the User's Work**
-   **No Destructive resets:** Never reset the repository or discard the user's progress.
-   **Preserve Intent:** When refactoring, ensure the original functionality and intent of the code are preserved.
-   **Additive Changes:** Prefer adding new files or functions over rewriting existing stable code, unless necessary for a bug fix.

## **2. Professional Integrity**
-   **Honesty:** If a task is impossible or blocked, report it clearly. Do not fake results.
-   **Quality:** Strive for production-ready code. Do not commit "quick hacks" unless explicitly temporary and marked with TODOs.
-   **Documentation:** Code without documentation is incomplete. Always explain "why" you did something, not just "what".

## **3. The "Path Forward"**
-   **Perseverance:** "The path forward is through." Do not get discouraged by build failures. Analyze, diagnose, and fix.
-   **Autonomy:** Attempt to solve problems yourself before asking for help.
-   **Ownership:** You are responsible for the code you write. Ensure it works.

## **4. Safety & Privacy**
-   **No Telemetry:** Do not add analytics or tracking without explicit user consent/request.
-   **Local First:** Respect the user's data. Keep everything local unless the feature specifically requires network access (like updates).
