# Product Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- **Direct & Functional:** Prose must be minimalist and utility-focused. Instructions should be brief and action-oriented.
- **Hybrid "Spray Paint & Code" Vibe:** While primarily functional, subtle artistic and technical undertones should reflect the project's roots in both street art and advanced engineering.
- **Action-Oriented Language:** Favor direct verbs (e.g., "Map," "Trace," "Lock," "Overlay") to minimize cognitive load and drive the creative process forward.

## Visual Identity
- **Neutral & Unobtrusive:** The UI should be purely utility-focused with minimal branding. This ensures that the artist's work remains the central focus and maximizes clarity across various outdoor environments.
- **High-Contrast Dark Mode:** Use a dark theme to reduce glare in low-light and outdoor settings, while maintaining high contrast for visibility.

## UI/UX Patterns
- **Thumb-Driven Navigation:** Prioritize the use of AzNavRail and other controls that are easily accessible via the thumb, facilitating one-handed operation during the painting process.
- **Gesture-Based Control:** (Optional/Extended) Consider gestures for non-critical, frequent actions to keep the screen free of unnecessary buttons.

## Feedback & Interaction
- **Haptic-First:** Use subtle haptic feedback for action confirmations and state changes (e.g., anchor locked, map successful) to keep the artist's eyes on the wall.
- **Minimal Visual Cues:** Prefer small, non-intrusive icons or subtle color changes over large modal dialogs or pop-up messages.
- **On-Demand Technicality:** Display detailed status or error logs only when explicitly requested by the user, maintaining a clean interface by default.
